# Getting Started with Create React App

Book-Store
The Bookstore is a website similar to the "Awesome Books" website built in the previous module. I will create an MVP version of it that allows the user to: Display a list of books. Add a book. Remove a selected book.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.
